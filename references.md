Project 6 of Udacity Front-End Nanodegree:Testing

Jasmine output from feedreader.js at the Starting State:


1 spec, 0 failures
Jasmine__TopLevel__Suite
RSS Feeds
are defined


#1: The first action(steps 5-6 in the project 6 direction): quote out by /* */ the content of allFeeds in app.js:

Result:
1 spec, 1 failure;
RSS Feeds are defined;
Expected 0 not to be 0.


#2. After the first action I wrote a few suits of tests following the prompt given in feedreader.js. I added a few
additional test per suggestions of the reviewer, as well as a test on error throwing.
