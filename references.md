Project 6 of Udacity Front-End Nanodegree:Testing

Jasmine output from feedreader.js at the Starting State:

1 spec, 0 failures
Jasmine__TopLevel__Suite

are defined

Action(steps 5-6): quote out by /* */ the content of allFeeds in app.js:
Result:
1 spec, 1 failure;
RSS Feeds are defined;
Expected 0 not to be 0.

Following that I included a few suits per prompts in the feedreader.js file.
